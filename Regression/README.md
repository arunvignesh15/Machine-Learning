What is Regression?

A statistical measure that attempts to determine the strengths of the relationship between one dependent variable(usually denoted by Y) and a series of the other changing variable (Known as independent variable). In another word: Regression is an mathematical technique used to estimate the cause and effect relationship among variables.

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like Salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then we are going to forecasting the future values.

There are numerous Regression techniques and here we will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Techniques in much simple and efficient way.

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification

So lets starts, Happy and Enjoy Machine Learning !!!
